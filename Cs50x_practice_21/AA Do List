In lecture 4 (1.08.51in) you came across buble sort/swap function etc that you can't remember much about.
This is in lecture 3 so you're going back to l.3 for now. The main file that deals with this is 'algorythms'

Latest items to revise:
Pointer variables
copy strings
malloc
valgrind(free memory)

You are going back to all the credit files (1 - 6) and adding the same code to it but this time with your own function. Do this before moving onto other code files.
