Ensure when you are testing for odd-positioned digits, you use:
if(position % 2 != 0)

If position, when divided by two, is not equal to zero (1,3,5,9 etc)

When trying to isolate first and first and second digits to test which numbers the card begins with, you need to set up variables with specific divide-by rules for each card. In my case, I called each variable the name of the card. 
Master, Amex and Visa. 

For example, if it's a 16 digit number (mastercard) you need to divide the card number a certain number of times to reach the first two numbers.
So this needs to be done individually according to the number of digits you are expecting.
