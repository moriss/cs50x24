Absolutely! A Makefile can help simplify the compilation 


This is the code that needs more explaining
# Makefile

# Compiler
CC = gcc
Below is now at google drive/coding/the make file

# Compiler flags
CFLAGS = -Wall -Wextra -g

# Target executable
TARGET = name

# Source files
SRCS = main.c

# Object files
OBJS = $(SRCS:.c=.o)

# Include directory
INCLUDES = -I/path/to/cs50

# Libraries
LIBS = -lcs50

all: $(TARGET)

$(TARGET): $(OBJS)
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -o $(TARGET) $(OBJS) $(LIBS)

%.o: %.c
	$(CC) $(CFLAGS) $(INCLUDES) -c $< -o $@

clean:
	rm -f $(OBJS) $(TARGET)


Certainly! Below is a simple
