//The holiday period is now over. Revert back to the system. Where Loops are used, try all three (1=for, 2=while and 3=do while loops). Finalise loops by marking 'c' after each number.
//NB: you tried using a new GetInt() from a later cs50 tutorial but it is throwing up an error possibly because you are running an old library. You need chat to help you download the new version.  

//ALSO, LOOK UP (VIA GOOGLE) HOW THE WALL BUILDING LOOPS WORK.
