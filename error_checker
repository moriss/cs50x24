Below, the #include<string.h> was missing
 warning: implicit declaration of function ‘strcmp’ [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  if(strcmp(approval,"Yes")==0);

1: Below printed when I forgot curly braces after the while condition.
EG while (x > y)
 
 warning: this ‘while’ clause does not guard... [-Wmisleading-indentation]

I added 'void' within main when calling the 'my' function. I should have ommited 'void' and just had: my(one,two);
 warning: parameter names (without types) in function declaration
  void my(one,two);


The easiest way to use this file is to paste actual error messages you experience and write down the fix alongside it.

expected declaration specifiers or ‘...’ before string constant
I place a closing curly brace the wrong way round.

expected ‘)’ before ‘x’
I forgot the comma in printf between the string and the variable.

control reaches end of non-void function
The output to my function is char (char* my()). This error occured because I did
 not add a return before the end closing brace. Instead of having to add a retur
n value, you can simply change your function to  void my() In this case, you fun
ction won't return a value.



Here I have noted down some common errors I make in my code. It's useful to read over it every now and then to cut down on the time in identifying and correcting 
errors as they arise. I try to paste the error message (when i remember to) as a helpful guide (for non logical errors).


Janurary 24
 too many arguments for format
int main()
{
	char * x = "john";
	printf("Hello \n" , x );
}
//You missed out the placeholder for the datatype  %s

The incrementing 'x' here, causes the program to (wrongly) run forever. The incrementing x needs to be placed within the confines of the 'do' in this do while loop.
int main(void)
{
    int x = 0;//Set 'x' to zero
    do {
            printf("Q ");//print this then...
            //x ++ should be here.
        }
    while (x <= 2);//keep printing while 'x' is less than or equal to 2
    x ++;// Placing the incrementing int here, causes the program to run forever.
    //It needs to be within the confines of the 'do' in this do while loop.

echo and variables

echo "$jon[3] $jon[2] $jon[1] $jon[0]";
Using speech marks respects one space between variables

echo $jon[3] , $jon[2] , $jon[1] , $jon[0];
Using commas instead does not.

Logical Error 3rd April 22
Using an if statement without the else.
'return' is used to stop the program at the relevant point. Where a condition is met, the program needs to return 0(by convention). But when the conditio
n is not met, the program returns 1(by convention). Not returning 1 and 0 at these points in the program brings up a logical error. (No output)

Example:
int main (void)
{
  int vex[9] = {1,3,5,7,9,13,50 ,17,19};//A statically initialised array
  for (int i = 0; i < 9; i ++)
  {
    if(vex[i] == 50)
    {
      printf("%i found it!" , vex[i]);
      return 0;
    }
  }
  printf("Not found!\n");
  return 1;
}






Logical Error.
Here, my code is compiling but there is a logical error. 
When using the while loop on its own, be sure to add curly breaces to the action you want to happen if the while condition is met.
EG:
while(this)
{
	do this
}
#####
Within a for loop, you mistakenly used comas to separate conditions etc, instead of semi colons. This brought up and error "function redefined!" or 
"redefinition of 'i'"
for(int i = 0, i < j, i ++)  should  be  for(int i = 0; i < j; i ++)



When working with longs in the various credit tasks,I often have a logic error where the code shows no errors but has no output (via print f) or something unusal
happens.
This is usually down to any of these 3 things. 
1. Not setting your counter or addup variable to zero (if being used) (error: initialize the variable counter to silence this warning)
2. not increminting counter by 1 at end of cycle, eg counter ++. (Usually creates a logical error, ie your code runs correctly but doesn't produce a result at 
printf)
3. Not dividing long by 10 to access next digit. (if you end up on an infinte loop, hit ctrl + c to kill the programe.


int addup = 0;
When accumulating (adding up) numbers, you need to initialise the variable ,say with zero, or it doesn't work.
Just having int addup; instead of int addup = 0; will likely bring up a logical error. Ie it will print a wrong answer.

HOWEVER, this doesn't seem to be required when setting a number into a variable such as x = card % 10;. Here, the variable only needs to be declared ie int x.
This also works if you initialise the variable, as above. So both way work. 

When accumulating different conditions of digits remember it is as below.

addup = addup + (card % 10) * 2;
and not
addup = (card % 10) * 2; This will put the lastmost digit on its own into addup. 


Where you write a function and call main, do not add the datatype to the function call in main or it messes things up.
error: a parameter list without types is only allowed in a function definition

eg  
void myf(char * x)
Above is the prototype in the header. 
But in main you just put
	myf(x)


cash:
while(cash >= fifty) {do this} THis works
while(cash => fifty) {do this} error: expected expression
THE SECOND EXAMPLE DOESN'T WORK BECAUSE 'EQUAL TO' COMES BEFORE GREATER THAN!!!

Logical error with cash:
Asking user for change required = 1.2 dollars.
The variable begins its journey as a float. float change = get_float("Change Required);
Now to get to the pennies so you can work with user's input, you need to divide by 100. 1.2 dollars eqauls 120 cents.
When dividing by 100 you use another variable with data type int to correctly store user's input . eg: int answer = change * 100;
The error occurs when you don't put the users input into a separate variable with datatypy int. 
The program will simply keep asking you for input rather than give you the answer you require.

Credit Problem:
To check starting numbers of digits, you need to make a copy of the original credit card number for this purpose. (original number preserved).


General
Often, you forget to place a comma after datatype placeholder and variable name. EG: printf("%li \n" , credit);
You do this instead printf("%li \n"  credit);


float and get_int.
very common to set a datatype as a float and when you want input from the user, you automatically type get_int instead of get_float.



PRINTING LONG NUMBERS
You don't need an array orloop to print out a credit card number 

eg:
int main (void)
{
    long credit = get_long("Number");
    
        printf("%li" , credit);
}
//This simply prints out the number you have inputed
//Working your way through the digits can be done with modulo and division.
int digit = credit % 10;  //Capture the lastmost digit from the long number (modulo)
credit = credit / 10;  //divide credit by 10 to get to the next digit you want to access (division)




//##########################################################
When using constants, they can't be added to abbreviated arrays such as first example below.(error! variable-sized object may not be initialized).
HOWEVER, in the first example, N in int assigns[N]  can be replaced with number of variables (3), or it can be left blank altogether.

Example 1
const int N = 3;
int main (void)
{
      int assigns[N] = {43, 34, 43};//So this needs to be int assigns[3] or int assign[] in order for it to work
      
      printf("%i \n",  (assigns[0] + assigns[1] + assigns[2]) / N);
}

Example 2
IT DOES, HOWEVER WORK IN THE EXAMPLE BELOW WHERE ARRAYS ARE LAYED OUT AND ITEMISED THUS.
const int N = 3;
int main (void)
{
      int assigns[N];
      assigns[0] = 43;
      assigns[1] = 33;
      assigns[2] = 49;
      
      printf("%i \n",  (assigns[0] + assigns[1] + assigns[2]) / N);
}

#################################################################

User input from the command line.
int main(int argc, string argv[]
'int argc counts the number of strings (arrays of strings).
'int argv stores the string values in an array (square brackets required to ensure string argv is indeed an array.
The first value/string of the array is the name of the file <./hello>.
Common error is to ommit either 'string' or '[]' at end of argv. Both argc and argv are named by convention.




*SEGMENTATION FAULTS*
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
1) Segmentation fault with hard coded variables.

In this example, seg fault is returned because you hardcoded *one. It's appears to be as simple as that. 
This seg fault is elimenated when you change 
char *one = "ivy" to 
char *one = get_string("String: "); (I don't know why but it solves the problem.)
 {
   char *one = "Ivy";//Here, changing this to get_string("name;" ); solves the seg fault issue. 
   char *two = "one";
   one[0] = toupper(one[0]);
   printf("%s\n",one);
   printf("%s\n",two);
}
STOPPED HERE
ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND RETURN VALUES FOR C AS A DIGIT, HAVE A LOOK AT BOOL
2) Can happen if you ommit [i] within a for loop condition.
isdigit = a digit between zero  and 9 (betwenn 48 and 57 inclusive on the ascii table)
Example below:
***if(isdigit(a[i]))***It needs the [i] which can be often missed
bool check_digit(string a)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < strlen(a); i ++)
    {
        if(isdigit(a[i]))
        {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}


3) Can happen when you haven't added a return value.

Example below :
The 'return 1;' at 'else', stops the program running since a certain condition is 
not met.
If you ommit 'return 1; here, you get a warning 'segmentation fault'.
